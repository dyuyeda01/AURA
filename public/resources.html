      <p class="text-gray-300 text-sm mt-3">
        AURA provides a unified view of daily cyber risk by fusing exploit intelligence, 
        vulnerability data, and AI-driven context. Each entry reflects the most relevant CVEs 
        with enrichment from public and open-source data feeds.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-3 text-gray-300 text-sm space-y-1">
        <li>Start with the <strong>Top 10 CVEs</strong> for immediate threat visibility.</li>
        <li>Expand any entry to see detailed scoring, trend data, and exploit references.</li>
        <li>Use the <strong>AURA Score</strong> to prioritize based on risk and likelihood of exploitation.</li>
        <li>Track how emerging AI-related vulnerabilities are shaping the cyber landscape.</li>

    <!-- Data Sources -->
    <section class="bg-gray-900/60 rounded-xl p-6">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-cyan-300">Data Sources</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-300 text-sm mt-2">
        AURA combines multiple trusted and open data sources to provide context and 
        scoring depth. Each component contributes a different dimension to the overall 
        risk calculation:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-3 text-gray-300 text-sm space-y-3">
        <li>
          <strong>CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV)</strong> — Identifies 
          vulnerabilities confirmed as actively exploited in the wild. This dataset drives 
          AURA’s baseline prioritization and marks which CVEs are proven threats.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>National Vulnerability Database (NVD)</strong> — Supplies 
          standardized metadata and CVSS severity scores, enabling consistency in 
          measuring technical impact and base risk.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>FIRST Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS)</strong> — Provides 
          a probabilistic forecast of exploitation. AURA integrates EPSS to 
          reflect real-world likelihood rather than theoretical severity.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Exploit-DB and GitHub Proof-of-Concepts</strong> — Confirms the 
          public availability of exploit code or demonstrations. When present, this 
          factor elevates urgency due to increased attacker accessibility.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>News & Advisory Feeds (NewsAPI)</strong> — Tracks how often a 
          CVE appears in trusted security publications. This “Trend” score indicates 
          visibility and awareness across the cybersecurity community.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>AI Context Analysis</strong> — Detects whether a CVE affects 
          machine learning frameworks, AI supply chain tools, or model-serving 
          infrastructure (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Vertex AI, Hugging Face). 
          This helps highlight risks that could impact AI-driven operations or 
          software supply chains.
        </li>

    <!-- Scoring Explanation -->
    <section class="bg-gray-900/60 rounded-xl p-6">
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-cyan-300">AURA Scoring Framework</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-300 text-sm mt-2">
        The AURA Score is a composite index that blends technical severity, 
        exploit probability, active exploitation, exposure trends, and AI-related 
        context into a unified 0–100 risk scale.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-400 text-xs mt-2">
        Weights are dynamically tuned to balance technical accuracy with operational relevance:
      </p>
      <ul class="ml-6 mt-2 text-gray-300 text-xs space-y-1">
        <li>CVSS: 40%</li>
        <li>EPSS: 20%</li>
        <li>KEV: 20%</li>
        <li>Exploit Availability: 10%</li>
        <li>Trend Awareness: 5%</li>
        <li>AI Context: 5%</li>
